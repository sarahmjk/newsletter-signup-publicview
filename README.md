newsletter using jQuery, heroku, js, html, css, bootstrap, node

It is connected to an actual mailchimp account, so please do not add a real email or name. It does have a failure page that redirects you and a success page if the informations has been added to mailchimp.

If you would like to see the code I used, I have attached files with empty API and ID. You still have to install JSON, node files, add a public file, and a procfile.

This url goes to my newsletter-signup using the heroku service: https://agile-ocean-09396.herokuapp.com/
