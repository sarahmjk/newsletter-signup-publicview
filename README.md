newsletter using jQuery, heroku, js, html, css, bootstrap, node

It is connected to an actual mailchimp account, so please do not add a real email or name. I made sure that none of the information you put in is not saved, so it should redirect you to a failure page with a button to take you back to registration. With the correct API, it would direct you to the success page.

If you would like to see the code I used, I have attached files with empty API and ID. You still have to install JSON, node files, add a public file, and a procfile.
